# Authentication App Dev Challenge React Express Mongo Firebase Passport

This is [the third challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/N1fvBjQfhlkctmwj1tnw) of the [Full-stack](https://devchallenges.io/paths/full-stack-developer) path from devChallenges. The challenge was to create an auth app that supports different authentication providers like Google or Github. To accomplish that, I've used Firebase to provide authentication for google and github accounts, and Passport for email accounts.

## How to use

```bash

# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/everydaycode20/auth-app-dev-challenge

## You should have mongodb installed on your computer

# Install dependencies for both folders
$ npm install

# For client folder make a build
$ npm run build

# Run the app the server 
$ npm start

# Run the client
$ npm start
```
